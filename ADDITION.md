CompSci 308: SLogo Addition
===================

### Estimation: before looking at the old code:
how long do you think it will take you to complete this new feature?

I think it will take me about 30 minutes to an hour to implement this new front end extension feature of adding  a new view that allows users to see the images of all of the turtles (active or not) and clicking on an image allowing the user change just that turtle's image.

how many files will you need to add or update? Why?

I will need to add and update quite a few files because first I will have to create a new class for this new view, then I will need to update resource files, the main GUI class, and the Turtle object to properly interact with the new class according to specifications. First, I will probably need to update the resource file to include the properties of this view. Then, I will need to update the main GUI class to instantiate and display this view on the workspace. Finally, I may need to make changes in the Turtle object to update its image because I am not sure if changing the image of the turtle was a feature implemented in the original product.

### Review: after completing the feature:
how long did it take you to complete this new feature?
how many files did you need to add or update? Why?
did you get it completely right on the first try?

### Analysis: what do you feel this exercise reveals about your project's design and documentation?
was it as good (or bad) as you remembered?
what could be improved?
what would it have been like if you were not familiar with the code at all?
