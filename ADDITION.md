## Estimation
* I think this extension will take 30-45 minutes to complete

* I will need to add/update 4 total classes: Gui - need to add to root, resource file - to add the x, y, width, height and other properties this view would need, Turtle - add method to get the image, add a imageViewer class that actually displays the images

## Review
* I ended up taking like 50 minutes to finish and it took 6 classes changes/additions to finish. In addition to the ones I said, I also needed to update a couple buttons that altered the image/added an image to the screen, so I had to update the imageViewer as these occurred. For coding, I did get it right on the first try - I felt like I had a very good grasp of exactly what I needed to change in order to get everything working. 

## Analysis
* It was about the same level of difficulty as I expected. It took some time to actually adjust the screen to fit in the imageViewer just because the screen was already so packed with stuff. I don't think there are any bugs within the imageViewer, but it could look a little more aesthetic on the frontend. I tried to follow the design of the rest of my code, but I can see how there could be improvement in the overall design of the project on my part. If it were somebody else coding, I think they would also not have too hard of a time with creating the extension, but that's due to everything existing in Gui class, so you really can add everything you need to create this imageViewer class into the constructor and code it as its own thing pretty much. The documentation could be slightly better however, I can tell how someone may get confused with updating the imageViewer as the image for the turtle is changed on the outside of the newly created class.
