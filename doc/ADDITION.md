Addition
===

### Estimation:
*  I think that implementing these new commands will not take more than 3 hours. I will have to make two new files corresponding to new commands and I think turtle and some class dealing with turtleScreen will have to be altered, because adding stamp will be like adding new turtle image to the screen that will not have any functionality. 


### Review: 
* It took me around an hour and a half to complete adding new feature, i.e. adding stamp and clearstamp commands. As I assumed I needed to update 2 classes and to add 2 as well. I did get it completely right on the first try.

### Analysis:
* This exercise definately required going back to the old code and reviewing it. This exercise, even tho listed as back end, mostly required adding  and changing classes that front end group worked on and since I worked on the backend side it was not the code I worked on. I can say that documentation was really good and helpful in understanding what methods do, however the design was very poor. I did remember that turtle class included way more information than it needed too. It contained all the methods we called from the backend and it contained all the information about other turtles as well, which was definately not good design but knowing that  definately made it esier for me to assume where the changes would happen in the first place. I also think if the design was better it should've taken me 15 minutes to complete the exercise. Since the extension on the back end took two minutes, and the rest of the time was spent figuring out what needs to be changes in the turtle class and front end classes.This tells a lot about the flexibility of our project design. If I had not be familiar with the code at all, it would probably taken me at least an hour or two longer to figure out how to add this new feature, because it would require going over larger portion of the code and understanding how it works, whereas I already knew how it worked and what classes should be altered.
